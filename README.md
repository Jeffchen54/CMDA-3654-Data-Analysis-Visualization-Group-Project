# CMDA_3654_Project
The Project spans the 2nd half of the semester and consists of 3 parts.  The estimated due dates are as follows. There are no late submissions for the project Parts.

Project discussion and team forming in class:  Thurs Oct 13
- Part 1 (Choosing teams and topics): Fri Oct 21
- Part 2 (First iteration of the data science process):  Fri Oct 28
- Part 3 (Second iteration, report and presentation):  Fri Dec 02 (presentations in class on Dec 06)

Teams: For the Project you should work in teams of 4-5 students. You are free to form your own teams.  

Goal: You will conduct a complete data science project of your choosing. The 2 iterations of the process in project Parts 2 & 3 are intended to enable an initial analysis, and then deepen the analysis with follow-up questions, all culminating in a final report. Your goal is to undertake the whole data science process as covered in class:

Define questions: Identify a problem topic of interest to your team, and define some interesting research questions to ask about that topic.
Collect Data: Gather a bunch of data on the topic that will help answer your research questions.
Process Data: Clean and process the data into usable form to be able to answer the research questions.
Visualize Data: View the data to gain insight into potential answers to the questions, and identify even deeper questions.
Analyze Data: Analyze the data, construct models relevant to your research questions, and formalize your answers.
Report: Report your results in written and visual form using Jupyter, and be prepared to present your report in class.

Project Requirements:  The project will be graded by the following criteria.
Problem:
  - Research Questions are clearly identified that are creative, interesting, and non-trivial, on a domain topic of interest to the team or a client.  Identifying a client who has a data problem is optional, but a good way to find interesting new research questions and data. 
Research Questions are rigorously defined to enable answers through data analysis.

Data:  choose at least 2 of these 3 requirements:
  - Data is scraped or computationally gathered from the web, or derived from a client problem.
  - Data is sufficiently large to answer interesting non-trivial questions.
  - Multiple data sources are joined to enable analysis of interesting new relationships (e.g. Homework3 is a good example; whereas, downloading a single table from    CORGIS as we did in some other homeworks is not adequate).

Analysis Process:
  - Analysis process demonstrates creativity, depth, and thoroughness in exploring the data.
  - Analysis process uses a variety of both visual and analytical methods (it is not required that you use all the methods covered in class).
  - Analysis process sufficiently and quantitatively formalizes answers to the Research Questions.
 
Report:  
  - Report is a Jupyter Notebook in QQQ format, with supporting data files.
  - Report provides insightful answers to interesting non-trivial research questions.
  - Report justifies answers with quantitative evidence.
  - Report presents questions and answers clearly and convincingly, making good use of visuals.
